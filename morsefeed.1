.SH DESCRIPTION
Command\-line tool that converts and processes text to be used for Morse code practice.
Text sources can be disk files or web pages.
Most punctuation and special characters are converted, removed, or spelled\-out.
Text can be output to disk file, standard output, or directly to mbeep tool.
If sent to mbeep, audio can be paused or resumed by typing space bar, or quit by typing the letter q.
There is an option to save the file position when quitting, and resume transmission from that point when starting again.
There are options to filter out text at the beginning or end of a file or web page. HTML tags are filtered out of web page text. There is an option to follow links from one web page, and use the text on the linked pages for practice. This is useful for text\-only news websites where the main page just contains links to articles.
A lengthy series of options can be saved as shortcut by using the \fB\-s\fR option and recalled by using the \fB\-r\fR option.

.SH NOTES
Punctuation marks that are copied without being spelled\-out are: period, comma, question mark, fraction bar, and equals sign.
Apostropes are removed, therefore contractions will appear as one word.

Web page unformatted list items (<ul>) are separated by the \fBAA\fR prosign. Text blocks from linked web pages (\fB-L\fR option) are separated by the \fBBT\fR prosign.
